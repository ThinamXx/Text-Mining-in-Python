# **Text Mining**

**Natural Language Processing**
- Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

**Note:**
- All the Notebooks included in this repository presents the implementation of Natural Language Processing such as Text Mining. These Notebooks are taken from the courses which I have completed from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Each Notebooks is the Implementation of Natural Language Processing. You can get insights about the Implementation of Natural Language Processing in real world problems such as:

  - [Spam Detection in Emails](https://github.com/ThinamXx/TextMining-in-Python/blob/master/Working%20with%20Emails%20and%20Detecting%20Spam.ipynb)
  - [Spelling Recommendation](https://github.com/ThinamXx/TextMining-in-Python/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20NLTK%20and%20Spelling%20Recommendation.ipynb)
  - [Implementation of NLTK](https://github.com/ThinamXx/TextMining-in-Python/blob/master/Implementation%20of%20NLTK.ipynb)
  
**NLTK**
- The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing for English written in the Python programming language.
  - The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP). It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.
